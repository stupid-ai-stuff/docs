title: "Announcing the Stupid AI Stuff Wiki"
---

Today we have created the [Stupid AI Stuff Wiki](https://docs.ai.burienstation.io) (`https://docs.ai.burienstation.io`). We hope to put together a list of useful documents that will help you accomplish the following goals:
- Use the AI bot more effectively for your day-to-day tasks.
- Write Better Prompts
- Learn about new Bot Features
- Learn about partner bots

We are currently experimenting with the format of this site and things are likely to change.

### Current State
Currently the site is using a **public** [Github Repository](https://github.com/stupid-ai-stuff/docs) and is published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via a [Github Actions Workflow](https://github.com/features/actions). The site is built and published as a static website via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with plugins customized for Github Pages.
