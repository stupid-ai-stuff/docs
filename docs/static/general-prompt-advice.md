## Writing Effective Prompts
Writing an effective prompt is not the same as a *google query*. A *google query* is looking for document that 'contain' that term or a relevant term, and return those documents to you. It is not completing a task. The use of GenerativeAI / LLMs is a completely different matter. You are asking a machine to complete the entire task. 

When writing a prompt, I find it helpful to position yourself as writing instructions to complete a task, where the person completing the task cannot interact with you until the task is fully complete.
