This tool, which includes this wiki, and the AI Bot on discord, do not belong to your company. *Uh Oh!*. Dont fear, you use many tools in your day to day job that are now owned by your company. Google, and StackOverflow are two easy examples. Use this tool in a similar fashion.

1. Dont **ever** includee confidential company information. When in doubt obfuscate it. The ai is very good at understanding placeholder such as `[Company Name]`. If you are still unsure, dont put it in. It is better to be safe than explaining to your friends and family that you were a moron.

Thats it. If you are still concerned with the usage of this tool, have a conversation with your boss.
